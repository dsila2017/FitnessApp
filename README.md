Overview

Our Nutrition App is designed to help users track their daily food intake, monitor their nutritional goals, and make informed decisions about their diet.

Progress Tracking: Monitor your progress over time with intuitive charts and graphs that visualize your nutritional intake and adherence to your goals.
CoreML supported: That means you can scan your food by your phone's camera and it will be automatically detected.
